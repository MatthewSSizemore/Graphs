Graphs

Design a format for storing graphs in files with the following requirements:

	The first line will contain the number of Vertices.

	The second line will have a ‘U’ or a ‘D’ to tell the system if it is Undirected or Directed.

	The rest of the lines will be here for each of the edges.  Each edge will contain three pieces of information:
		An integer containing the first Vertex
		An integer containing the second Vertex
		An integer containing the weight

	You will need to wright two functions for your graph, read and write.

	bool read(string filename);
	bool wright(string filename);


The file must be human readable (use a txt file please).

Here is a sample input file.

Input.txt

6               # Number of vertices
U               # Undirected graph
0 4 9           # List of Edges
0 2 7
2 3 1
2 1 5
2 5 2
